# Conclusion
This analysis of Airbnb listings in Copenhagen highlights the status of the platform in the city. The number of listings has increased significantly over the past two years and the majority of the listings as expected in concentrated in the central areas of Copenhagen, particularly around the city center. The vast majority of listings are owned by hosts with a single property, but the majority of multiple listing accounts are owned by business hosts. This business side of Airbnb raises concerns about the commercialization of the platform and its impact on the housing market in Copenhagen. A positive aspect is that the insight we got from the availability of the listings, which is that the majority of the listings are available for a couple of weeks per year. This is a strong indicator that the platform is used by hosts to rent out their properties for short periods of time, probably when they are not using them (vacation).
