We will first explore the temporal trends in Airbnb listings in Copenhagen to understand how the number of listings has evolved over time. The interactive visualization **[Figure 1](#airbnb_listings_time)** displays the number of listings per month from 2010 to 2024. There is the option to observe the aggregated rentals with a monthly granularity and the ability to observe the new entries each month.

The first thing that one can see is the repeated pattern of a drop in listings during the winter months, followed by a peak in the summer months. This pattern is consistent throughout the years, indicating a seasonal trend in the number of listings. A possible explanation for this trend will be given further in the analysis.  
A noticable drop can be observed in the number of listings in 2020, which can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The subsequent recovery and rapid growth in listings post-pandemic highlight the resilience of the Airbnb market in Copenhagen. It is important to mention that during 2023, the number of new listings was to slightly less than 5,000 listings, which accounts to approximately 1/3 of the total listings in the city. This indicates a high turnover of listings in the platform, which can have implications on the housing market dynamics.  
This increasing trend should definitely ring a bell for the local authorities to keep an eye on the platform and its impact on the housing market.
