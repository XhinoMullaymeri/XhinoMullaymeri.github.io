## Who owns the listings?

So far, we have explored the temporal and spatial dimensions of Airbnb listings in Copenhagen but who really owns these listings? Are they individual hosts or commercial operators? To answer these questions, we analyze the distribution of listings based on the total number of listings per host. **[Figure 3](#listings_per_host)** below, displays the distribution of Airbnb listings in Copenhagen based on the total number of listings per host. For extra information of the hosts, the table **[Figure 4](#table_hosts)** provides a detailed overview of the distribution of listings per host and a redirection to their page is facilitated by clicking on the name.

After analyzing the ownership of Airbnb listings in Copenhagen, we observe that a significant portion of listings ~14% are owned by hosts with multiple properties. This concentration of ownership raises concerns about the commercialization of Airbnb and its impact on housing availability for long-term residents.  
The table provides a detailed overview of the distribution of listings per host, highlighting the presence of mostly commercial operators with multiple listings. Only 7 out of the 37 hosts do not have the "business" mark on their airbnb pages. By clicking on the host's name, you can access their Airbnb page to explore more details about their listings and ownership patterns.  
Even though that the ~85% of the listings are owned by hosts with a single property, this concentration of listings in the hands of a few hosts underscores the need for a proper regulations to ensure a fair and sustainable housing market in Copenhagen.
