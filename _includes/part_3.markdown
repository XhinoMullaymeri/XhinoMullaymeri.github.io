# Investigating DUI and severe/fatal accidents spatial distributions.
In this section, we will investigate the spatial distribution of DUI incidents and severe/fatal accidents in San Francisco. 
For this purpose, we will augement our analysis with the **[Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Crashes-Resulting-in-Injury/ubvf-ztfx/about_data)** dataset provided by SFDPH/SFPD. This dataset includes over 55,000 records of traffic crashes in San Francisco from 2005 to 2024, providing information for the location of the accident, time, the severity and more. For the purpose of this analysis, we will focus on the years 2005 to 2017, as the DUI dataset ends in 2017.

With this interactive visualization, by adding all the severe/fatal accidents in San Francisco, we can observe that the majority of severe/fatal accidents are concentrated in the central and northern parts of San Francisco. Furthermore, we can add the DUI incidents and actually find the accidents that are related to DUI incidents. This is a crucial step to as in order to prevent DUI incidents and especially severe/fatal accidents, we need to where they are more likely to occur. This can be achieved by making police forces more alert and active in these areas.  
Another observation is that the number of DUI incidents is higher in the districts with the highest number of severe/fatal accidents. This suggests that the concentration of DUI incidents is associated with the presence of severe/fatal accidents in these areas. This is a crucial observation as it indicates that the areas with the highest number of severe/fatal accidents are also the areas with the highest number of DUI incidents. This is a clear indication that the police forces should be more alert and active in these areas to prevent DUI incidents and especially severe/fatal accidents.

**Figure 3:** The left side of this interactive visualization shows the distribution of DUI incidents (light blue markers) and severe/fatal accidents (red markers) in San Francisco. The right plot depicts the number of DUI incidents (blue bars) and number of Crashes (red bars) as per selected filteres of the user. Users can filter the data by year, month, day of the week and switch between dui/crashes markers by clicking the correspoding tab. Note, Crashes dataset start from 2005.

As it was mentioned before, DUI incidents are more likely during the weekends, especially on Friday and Saturday. This is also the case for severe/fatal accidents. This is a crucial observation as it indicates that the police forces should be more alert and active during the weekends to prevent DUI incidents and crash accidents. Users can filter the data by year, month, day of the week to see the distribution of DUI incidents and severe/fatal accidents in San Francisco on the right plot.
