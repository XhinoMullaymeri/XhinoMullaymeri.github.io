# Investigating DUI and severe/fatal accidents spatial distributions.
In this section, we will investigate the spatial distribution of DUI incidents and severe/fatal accidents in San Francisco. 
For this purpose, we will augment our analysis with the **[Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Crashes-Resulting-in-Injury/ubvf-ztfx/about_data)** dataset provided by SFDPH/SFPD. This dataset includes over 55,000 records of traffic crashes in San Francisco from 2005 to 2024, providing information on the location of the accident, time, severity, and more. For the purpose of this analysis, we will focus on the years 2005 to 2017, as the DUI dataset ends in 2017.

With this interactive visualization, by mapping all severe/fatal accidents in San Francisco, we observe that the majority are concentrated in the central and northern parts of the city. Additionally, overlaying DUI incidents allows us to identify accidents directly related to DUIs. This analysis is crucial, as pinpointing where severe/fatal accidents are more likely to occur is essential for prevention efforts. Enhancing police activity in these areas could help reduce the incidence of DUI incidents and, consequently, severe/fatal accidents.

**Figure 3:** The left side of this interactive visualization displays the distribution of DUI incidents (light blue markers) and severe/fatal accidents (red markers) over the map of San Francisco. The right plot shows the number of DUI incidents (blue bars) and number of crashes (red bars) according to the filters selected by the user. Users can filter the data by year, month, day of the week, and toggle between DUI/crashes markers by clicking the corresponding tab. Note that the crashes dataset begins in 2005


As previously mentioned, DUI incidents have higher rates during weekends, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. This trend is mirrored in the occurrence of severe/fatal accidents, emphasizing the need for higher police vigilance and proactive measures during these times to prevent DUI incidents and related accidents. The interactive visualization allows users to filter data by year, month, and day of the week, enabling a detailed examination of the distribution of DUI incidents and severe/fatal accidents in San Francisco, as shown on the right plot
