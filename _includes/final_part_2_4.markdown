One of the most interesting insights can be derived from these distributions, is the fact that 50% of the listings are available for less than 18 days for the following year and 36% of the listings have **0** days available. This indicates that a significant portion of listings in Copenhagen are not available for booking (at the time of data collection), which seems to indicate a seasonal availability pattern. This could be due to the fact that some hosts only make their listings available during certain times of the year, as they might be using the property themselves. At this point, it is important to mention that the data was collected in the month of January, which is typically a low season for tourism in Copenhagen and when a rental property is booked for a certain period then the availability is reduced by that period.  
Another observation is that the majority of listings are entire homes or apartments, which account for 90.5% of the total listings while the private rooms constitute 9.4%. This indicates that the short-term rental market in Copenhagen is dominated by entire homes or apartments, which could have implications for the availability of long-term rental properties in the city.  
For the prices, we can observe that 1/4 of the listings have a price below 850 DKK, 1/2 of the listings have a price below 1150 DKK, and 3/4 of the listings have a price below 1500 DKK. This indicates that there is a wide range of prices available in the short-term rental market in Copenhagen, catering to different budgets and preferences.  
Finally, the review score distribution suggests that the quality of listings in the city is generally high as 97% has a rating of 4 stars, which could contribute to the popularity of short-term rentals among visitors and tourists.
