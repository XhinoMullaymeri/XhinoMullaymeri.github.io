# Introduction
In this project, we will conduct an analysis of the San Francisco Crime Data, with a particular emphasis on incidents of driving under the influence (DUI) recorded between 2003 and 2017. The **[Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data)** dataset we will explore, includes over two million records, spanning 37 categories of crime. It provides comprehensive details on each incident, including the date, time, and location, offering a rich source for examination and insight into criminal activity in the city.  

According to the **[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving)**, drunk driving is a significant cause of traffic accidents, injuries, and fatalities in the United States. More specifically, the **[State of California Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2021/03/2016-Annual-Report-of-the-California-DUI-Management-Information-System.pdf)** annual reports show more than 30% of all traffic fatalities in California are alcohol-related. Therefore, it is essential to understand the patterns and trends of DUI incidents to develop effective strategies for prevention and enforcement.
