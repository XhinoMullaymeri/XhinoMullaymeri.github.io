# Introduction
In this project, we will conduct an analysis of the San Francisco Crime Data, placing particular emphasis on incidents of driving under the influence (DUI) recorded between 2003 and 2017. We will explore the **[Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data)** dataset, which includes over two million records, spanning 37 categories of crime. It provides comprehensive details on each incident, including the date, time, and location, offering a rich source for examination and insight into criminal activity in the city.  

According to the **[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving)**, drunk driving is a significant cause of traffic accidents, injuries, and fatalities in the United States. More specifically, the **[State of California Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2021/03/2016-Annual-Report-of-the-California-DUI-Management-Information-System.pdf)** annual reports show that more than 30% of all traffic fatalities in California are alcohol-related. Therefore, understanding the patterns and trends of DUI incidents is essential to developing effective strategies for prevention and enforcement.
