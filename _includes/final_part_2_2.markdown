## Airbnb listings through space
Let's now have a look at the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings in Copenhagen. The map below shows the concentration of listings in different neighborhoods of the city. With lighter shades indicating higher concentrations and with markers showing the location of listings, this **[video](#listings_per_neighbourhood)** visualization provides a clear picture of how listings are distributed across the city. More information about the listings can be obtained by hovering on the markers and a redirection to the actual airbnb page is facilitated by clicking on the markers.

The map reveals that the majority of listings are concentrated in the central areas of Copenhagen, particularly around the city center and the waterfront. The neighborhoods of Indre By, Vesterbro, and Frederiksberg have the highest density of listings, reflecting their popularity among tourists and visitors, something which is expected as these areas are close to the main attractions of the city. The spatial distribution of listings highlights the importance of location in attracting guests and generating revenue on the platform. It also raises questions about the impact of short-term rentals on the availability of housing in these central areas, where demand is high and supply is limited especially in house markets that have a shortage like Copenhagen.

By hovering over the markers, some might notice that there are listings which do not have a price associated with them. This is due to the fact that the price was not available at the time of data collection. This is due to the fact that some listings are not always available for rental. Something which will discuss down the line in the analysis.
