# Conclusion

In this project we conducted an analysis of the San Francisco DUI incidents recorded between 2003 and 2017. We highlighted that there are certain days and times of the week that the number of DUI incidents is higher, especially during the weekends. We also found that the districts with the highest number of DUI incidents are located in the central and northen parts of the city, peaking in Mission. Same districts that have the majority of nightlife and entertainment venues. Lastly, we wanted to demonstrate the importance preventing DUI incidents by augmenting our analysis with traffic crashes data. We found that areas with the highest number of accidents are also the areas with the highest number of DUI incidents. This is a clear indication that the police forces should be more alert and active in these areas to prevent DUI incidents even more in these areas as they are more likely to result in severe/fatal accidents.
